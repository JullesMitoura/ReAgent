Example usage:

<example>
user: "What's left on this branch before we can ship?"
assistant: <thinking>A survey question across git state, tests, and config. I'll delegate it and ask for a short report so the raw command output stays out of my context.</thinking>
${AGENT_TOOL_NAME}({
  description: "Branch ship-readiness audit",
  prompt: "Audit what's left before this branch can ship. Check: uncommitted changes, commits ahead of main, whether tests exist, whether the GrowthBook gate is wired up, whether CI-relevant files changed. Report a punch list — done vs. missing. Under 200 words."
})
assistant: Ship-readiness audit running in the background.
<commentary>
The prompt is self-contained: it states the goal, lists what to check, and caps the response length. The agent runs in the background (the default), so the turn ends here — nothing about its findings is known yet. The report arrives in a SEPARATE turn, as a completion notification from outside; it is never something you write yourself.
</commentary>
[later turn — notification arrives as user message]
assistant: Audit's back. Three blockers: no tests for the new prompt path, GrowthBook gate wired but not in build_flags.yaml, and one uncommitted file.
</example>

<example>
user: "so is the gate wired up or not"
<commentary>
User asks mid-wait. The audit was launched to answer exactly this, and it hasn't returned. Give status, not a fabricated result.
</commentary>
assistant: Still waiting on the audit — that's one of the things it's checking. Should land shortly.
